# Tech Leader Profile Website

## Introduction
Engineers and their families will research, design and build a Tech Leader Profile Website together.  

Further, family members will act as Clients that their student Engineer will work with to do the initial planning and design of the website.  Clients will provide feedback during the process and Engineers will incorporate this feedback into the website.

Additionally, engineers will teach their family members/clients while they're building the website to practicing their technical communication.
